# MESH

## What This Is

MESH is a Rust-based, Wayland-native shell framework that pushes service behavior into Luau plugins while keeping the Rust core focused on generic runtime wiring, state delivery, and diagnostics.

## Current State

`v1.1` shipped on 2026-05-05.

The project now has a backend plugin MVP with:

- A shell-owned installed-plugin package manifest and normalized plugin graph
- Explicit active-provider selection for backend service categories
- Deterministic backend runtime lifecycle with visible status and diagnostics
- A locked backend Luau MVP API: `mesh.exec(program, args)`, `mesh.config()`, `mesh.log(level, msg)`, `mesh.service.emit(...)`, and `mesh.service.set_poll_interval(ms)`
- Generic service state and command routing without service-specific Rust branches
- A reference backend plugin plus automated proof coverage and backend author docs

`v1.2` shipped on 2026-05-08.

The project now also has a rendering-system upgrade with:

- Practical CSS-like styling support with diagnostics, shorthands, token resolution, and author documentation
- Container-size and interaction-state restyling that keeps layout, paint, hit-testing, and accessibility state synchronized
- Selectable rendered text with theme-owned highlight colors and explicit copy routing
- Shell-owned keyboard focus traversal, focus-visible styling, and shortcut handling
- Theme animation tokens and constrained CSS animation playback for supported visual properties
- A richer shipped navigation bar that proves the milestone on a real shell surface

## Next Milestone Framing

- Decide the next milestone after closeout rather than carrying forward stale `v1.2` planning text.
- Keep deferred validation and human-verification debt visible, but separate it from the next milestone's product goal.
- Build on the shipped styling, keyboard, selection, and animation foundation instead of reopening browser-engine scope.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Backend plugins use Luau for service logic | Keeps Rust core as wiring and makes services extensible | Locked |
| Rust core must stay generic across services | Prevents audio/network/power special cases from becoming architecture | Locked |
| Package graph comes before backend lifecycle | A unified installed-plugin interface should drive which backend providers exist and which one is active | Shipped in v1.1 |
| Backend runtime failure does not auto-fallback | Deterministic cleanup and visible status are safer than hidden provider switching | Locked |
| `mesh.exec_shell` is outside the backend MVP host API | Structured argv execution avoids shell parsing ambiguity | Shipped in v1.1 |
| Backend MVP comes before remote distribution and LSP | Runtime stability and local package semantics are prerequisites for tooling and package workflows | Still true |
| MESH renderer should support practical shell CSS, not full web compatibility | Plugin authors need expressive styling without inheriting browser-engine scope | Decided in v1.2 |

## Previous Milestone Framing

### v1.2 Rendering System Upgrade

The `v1.2` milestone centered on making MESH rendering expressive enough for distinctive shell UI without turning the renderer into a browser engine. It focused on practical CSS coverage, container and interaction reactivity, text selection and copy, keyboard navigation, animation support, and the navigation bar as the proof surface.

### v1.1 Backend Plugin MVP

The `v1.1` milestone centered on making backend plugins stable enough for MVP by first introducing a unified shell-owned plugin package manifest, then using it to drive backend lifecycle, provider selection, host APIs, service contracts, and diagnostics.

Target features included the central plugin package manifest, frontend-to-backend dependency declaration, backend lifecycle control, the backend host API contract, service provider contracts, runtime diagnostics, and a fresh reference plugin proving the authoring path.
