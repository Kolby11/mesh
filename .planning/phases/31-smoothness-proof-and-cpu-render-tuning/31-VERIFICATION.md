# Phase 31 Verification

## Status

`gaps_found`

Automated CPU-render proof and conservative threshold tuning are complete. Final visible smoothness acceptance remains deferred because live manual UAT was not run in this headless terminal session.

## Commands

- PASS: `env XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/codex-nix-cache nix develop -c cargo fmt --check`
- PASS: `env XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/codex-nix-cache nix develop -c cargo test -p mesh-core-render display_list`
- PASS: `env XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/codex-nix-cache nix develop -c cargo test -p mesh-core-render icon`
- PASS: `env XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/codex-nix-cache nix develop -c cargo test -p mesh-core-render text_cache`
- PASS: `env XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/codex-nix-cache nix develop -c cargo test -p mesh-core-shell profiling`
- PASS: `env XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/codex-nix-cache nix develop -c cargo test -p mesh-core-shell phase26_real_surface_baseline_emits_canonical_proof_measurements -- --nocapture`

## Evidence

- The canonical shipped-surface proof test now emits `PHASE31_PROOF` rows for `hover`, `surface_open_close`, `pointer_update`, `keyboard_traversal`, and `backend_update`.
- Repaint policy threshold selection now uses a two-thirds surface-area full repaint threshold while preserving the three-quarters changed-entry tree rebuild fallback.
- Focused shell policy tests cover zero damage, small single damage, below-threshold extra damage, two-thirds full-surface promotion, and tree rebuild entry thresholds.
- Existing retained display-list tests continue to prove filtered survivor ordering, root/background replay, scrollbar span inclusion, and full-surface fallback metrics.
- Cache capacities were intentionally left unchanged: raster capacity remains `256`, text layout capacity remains `128`.
- Existing icon and text cache tests continue to cover freshness, SVG external-resource bypass, tint/multicolor key separation, non-UTF path identity, opaque/translucent hit reporting, text layout hits, and layout-affecting misses.

## Scope Boundary

No GPU backend, parallel paint/layout implementation, new benchmark harness, trace persistence, or broad shell UI redesign was added.

## Residual Risk

- `31-UAT.md` has all five canonical manual checks marked `skipped`, not `pass`, because no live visual shell UAT was performed in this session.
- `31-01-BENCHMARK.md` marks all five acceptance decisions `deferred`; automated counters alone are not accepted as visible smoothness proof.
- The current shipped-surface proof rows still report `full_surface` policy because the canonical scenarios reach full-rebuild paths. Smaller retained damage paths are protected by focused policy tests, but not yet proven as visible end-user smoothness wins.

## Follow-Up

- Run `$gsd-verify-work 31` or a live manual UAT pass to exercise `hover`, `surface_open_close`, `pointer_update`, `keyboard_traversal`, and `backend_update` on shipped shell surfaces.
- If visual lag remains after this conservative CPU threshold work, continue with the planned Skia/GPU renderer investigation or later parallel paint/layout work after retained ownership boundaries are proven.
