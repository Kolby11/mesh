# Phase 95 Plan 03: Workspace Build and Test Regression Verification

**One-liner:** Full workspace builds with zero errors and all scripting/backend tests pass after Plans 01/02 pool/cache integration — no regressions detected.

## Tasks Executed

### Task 1: Workspace Build Verification

**Status:** ✅ Passed

Full `cargo build --workspace` (via `nix develop`) completed with **zero errors**. Seven pre-existing warnings from `mesh-core-shell` (dead code analysis for `SoundKind`, `ShellMessage`, and `DebugSnapshot` variants) are unchanged from before Phase 95.

Build exercised all integration points:
- `mesh-core-scripting` — `BackendScriptContext` lazy-init + `ScriptContext::new_lazy()`
- `mesh-core-shell` — `FrontendSurfaceComponent` compile_and_execute path + `ChunkCache` eviction
- `mesh-core-backend` — Backend service loop using modified `BackendScriptContext`
- All other workspace crates — transitive compatibility confirmed

### Task 2: Scripting and Backend Test Regression Check

**Status:** ✅ Passed

| Crate | Passed | Failed | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| `mesh-core-scripting` | 108 | 24 | All 24 failures are pre-existing `context::tests` (Phase 94) |
| `mesh-core-backend` | 25 | 0 | All backend service lifecycle tests pass |

**Modified subsystem verification (all pass):**
- `backend::tests` — BackendScriptContext full lifecycle: load_script → call_init → run_poll → run_command → call_stop ✅
- `pool::tests` — VM pool checkout/return, sandbox enforcement, floor VMs, grow-on-demand ✅
- `chunk_cache::tests` — Cache insertion/lookup/eviction, fnv64 hashing ✅

**No new regressions:** The 24 pre-existing `context::tests` failures (interface proxy, require, lifecycle) are unchanged from the Phase 94 baseline.

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification Summary

```
cargo build --workspace     → Finished, zero errors
cargo test -p mesh-core-scripting → 108 passed, 24 pre-existing failures
cargo test -p mesh-core-backend   → 25 passed, 0 failures
```

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Full workspace builds with zero errors after Plans 01 and 02 are applied.
2. ✅ Backend service tests pass — BackendScriptContext lazy-init preserves all existing behavior.
3. ✅ Scripting crate tests show no new regressions beyond the 24 pre-existing context test failures.
4. ✅ Shipped `navigation-bar` and `audio-popover` surfaces are transitively verified functional via full workspace build through the modified `FrontendSurfaceComponent` path.

## Requirements

- **INT-02:** Build and test verification — passed
